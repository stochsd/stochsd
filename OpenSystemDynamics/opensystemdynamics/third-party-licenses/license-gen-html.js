				"license_text": `Insight Maker's source code is released under a custom license based on the Affero GPL. This license covers all Insight Maker’s JavaScript, HTML, and CSS code for the Insight Maker model builder and simulator. It does not cover 3rd-party code that the Insight Maker model builder and simulator links to such as MxGraph or ExtJS.

## Insight Maker Public License

All clauses and components of the AGPL apply to the Insight Maker Public License with the following modifications:

* All references to the AGPL, are replaced with references to the Insight Maker Public License.

* Linked code that is used on InsightMaker.com that is not covered by the Insight Maker Public License (such as MxGraph), is not subject to the corresponding sources must be issued under the same or compatible license clauses of the Insight Maker Public License. Uses of other code covered under the Insight Maker Public License may also link to these same libraries without requiring them to be issued under a compatible license.

* The above modification only applies to code libraries linked to on InsightMaker.com. Projects using code covered under the Insight Maker Public License which links to or relies on code not used at InsightMaker.com, must ensure that that linked code is issued under the Insight Maker Public License or a compatible license. Please note that a user added link on InsightMaker.com does not constitute a code library link as used by this license.

* An acknowledgment of the use of InsightMaker.com code and a link back to InsightMaker.com must be included in any projects using code covered under the Insight Maker Public License. These credits must be visible "above the fold" on all displays generated by programs using software including the Insight Maker Public License. These credits and links must be of a size that is not smaller than 80% of the size of the largest typeface used on the displays in which they are contained.

The Insight Maker Public License specifically does not give you a license to use MxGraph, ExtJS, or other software that is linked to at InsightMaker.com. If you wish to use these in conjunction with code covered under the Insight Maker Public License, you must obtain separate licenses from the respective parties that are compatible with the Insight Maker Public License.
